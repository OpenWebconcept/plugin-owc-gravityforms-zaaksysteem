# TO-DO

Please please take note; the code is very nasty but serves as a POC. There is no need to clean everything up since the requirements and mijn-taken API are likely to change.

- Preprare generic form for altering the 'Taak' status
- Single page 'Taak' with form combined
- Finding applicable form is now being done by css class, create form setting instead
- Finding applicable form field which are populated on render needs to be done better and more robust
